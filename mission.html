      <li>Energy conservation is the effort made to reduce the consumption of energy by using less of an energy service. This can be achieved either by using energy more efficiently (using less energy for a constant service) or by reducing the amount of service used (for example, by driving less). Energy conservation is a part of the concept of eco-sufficiency. Energy conservation reduces the need for energy services and can result in increased environmental quality, national security, personal financial security and higher savings.[
        <li>1] It is at the top of the sustainable energy hierarchy.This is a very important message from our mother earth. We need to cherish our resource. Dream big and act well. Sleep good, eat good, do things good.Take a good nap just another day to wake up to sun a nd tomorrow</td>

      <li>Energy can only be transformed from one form to other, such as heat energy to motive power in cars, or kinetic energy of water flow to electricity in hydroelectric power plants. However machines are required to transform energy from one form to other. The wear and friction of the components of these machine while running cause loss of quadrillions of BTU and $500 billions in industries only in USA. It is possible to minimize these losses by adopting green engineering practices to improve life cycle of the components.(Ref
        <li>.R.Chattopadhyay:Green Tribology, Green Surface Engineering and Global Warming', ASM International,USA, 2014. Also 3 books by same author published earlier on wear, surface engineering and global warming.)2] It also lowers energy costs by preventing future resource </td>
    <td>
      <li>One of the primary ways to improve energy conservation in buildings is to perform an energy audit. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system with an eye toward reducing energy input without negatively affecting output. This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above. Recent development of smartphone apps enables homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated energy audi
        <li>ts themselves.[6]

Building technologies and smart meters can allow energy users, both commercial and residential, to visualize the impact their energy use can have in their workplace or homes. Advanced real-time energy metering can help people save energy by their actions.[7]</td>

    <h4>We connect buyers and sellers of Renewable Energy together</h4>

      <strong> How we do this</strong>:
From the clip below we can see the journey of Sally the Seller and Barry the Buyer.
They are both connected through our platform
which is a marketplace for renewable energy. As soon as Sally produces a surplus of
renewable energy from her own energy system she offers it on our platform. Barry sees
her offer and can instantly buy the electricity sold by Sally.
The entrance fee for this marketplace is a subscription fee of Â£1 per week.
Through connecting Sally and Barry directly together without a utility company in
the middle, the market creates a much better margin for Sally. She earns more
money for the energy she is selling and her renewable energy system is paid off
 earlier than expected.
But it's not all about the price, it's about disrupting a conservative market
and creating value for both sides, buyers and sellers. This renewable energy
 movement is important, and we want to be a part of it.
